# SSE-test

This project is designed to test Server-Sent Events (SSE).

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to experiment with and demonstrate the use of Server-Sent Events, a technology that allows servers to push real-time updates to web clients over HTTP.

## Features

- Simple setup for testing SSE
- Example code for both server and client
- Useful for learning and debugging SSE implementations

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies (if any).
3. Run the server and open the client to observe SSE in action.

## License

This project is for educational and testing purposes.
